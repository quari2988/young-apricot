           there is a big, enormeous, giagantic, jug of pineapple juice in my refrigerator. its sweet but its also distasteful.
           the first sip is always weird but the after taste is... interesting. the smell is indescribable. 
           imagine pineapple pie. there is pineapple unside down cake, but why not pie?

            about a week ago iwent to walmart, great, fantastic, place to shop. it has all of one needs and various discoveries.
            i went on the hunt to find a new keyboard and pie! i love pie. pie is so tasty. the pies at walmart are creamy, 
            light and fluffy with so much flavor and sweetness. unlike anything anyone will ever have. best party about
            it is that the pies are only 50 cents. perfect for the adverage broke man. theat movie norman... great movie. 
            chucky cheese smells really bad but has good wings but the tokens cost alot. cinnimon buns, one of the greatest pasties ever created. 
            especially when its warm, and large...pause! but 7$ is alot but it was worth. fantastic...4... first 2 movies, great, but that 2014 moive.. 
            absolutley dreadful.

            there are just some of those people out there with some great laughs.
            however you come across that those people with either annoying laughs or hidious laughs. people with dark humor.
            never understood why some people think death is funny. cream corn is disgusting.
            feminist... dont like men but do they enjoy their fathers? socks. warm, cozy but dont acually warm your feet with it cold. i spent $7 on snacks yesturday and it was worth it.
            i also went to gamestop. why, i dont know because i despise gamestop. i brought mario cart, for ds, and i plan to return it, today. 
            i love playing videos games but the games i wanna play i cant. either i dont wanna buy them or i dont have the console. corn syrup sucks. bad for ypur body but in candy
            and i like some candy. i dont like apples or the apple brand product. its too exppensive, 
            they charge you for the color, and they have too many numbers. its like theres a 5, a 5s, a 5s+ like just give me a phone! i dont understand how when ever the new iphone comes 
            everybodys all in line ready to go in debt and become homeless beacuse they couldnt pay there bills for the next 2years because they brought a cell phone buy APPLE! 
            also i like oranges. fruit snacks are amazing. a good size packed with flavor. i have yet to meet another guy named dayquan. the most enjoyable times of life was summer camp.
            mostly because it was with ghetto people in ghetto schools. and it not camp. i never once acually did those camp activites you see on tv and go to some camp ground and live a
            lodge or something in the woods for the whole summer. i remember this one camp i when to, i walked in, all of sudden there like everybody line up. its monday, where doing karate.
             </p> 
        <p> 
            i get all excited. i was strecting thinks we were about to spare or something. teacher walks in and starts chanting karate lanuage. 
            he taughs us punches and kicks and im waiting for him to show how to fight like goku. 
            fast forward some more, we had dance class. the women didnt what she was doing. some kid literally stood
            in the back of calss and took a krap and stood there instead of going to the bathroom. 
            hes mom came and got his that day. side note i was in the bathroom and some black lady came in the whoop her child.
            i didnt know what to think when the girls bathroom was two feet away. i also remember this on time i slammed a girl into a tree. she got on my nerves that day. 
            first she put rocks down my back, then stole my shoes, i was pissed but not mad enough yet to throw her into a tree. what set me off was when she put a catapiller on my shoulder.
             im afraid of all animals so that set me off. i went super saiyan on her. i flew through the park caught and right in front of her mom too i slammed her right into that tree.
            some feminist starts shouting at me but what i couldnt belive was that i hurt myself more than i hurt her. i thought we wasnt gonna be friends no more after that but we was cool
            and i acually was at a water park and i saw that same girl. i thought she remembered the situation so i didnt wanna engage but i dont think she did.

            a differnent time, in a differnt type setting, i had summer school. dont why, never wanted it, never needed it. i had this teacher named mr. bigfoot. i remembe we had a sub on day.
            that broad was mean. im pretty sure it was a clase full of dudes and she wasnt having it. i kid not i asked the braod can i use the bathroom. she says no. i really had to go. im 
            standing there doing the pee pee dance. i run out, bathroom is right next to the classroom. unfortunately, the bathroom were locked! so i waterfalled! didnt care. i blame that mean
