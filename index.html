           there is a big, enormeous, giagantic, jug of pineapple juice in my refrigerator. its sweet but its also distasteful.
            the first sip is always weird but the after taste is... interesting. the smell is indescribable. 
            imagine pineapple pie. there is pineapple unside down cake, but why not pie?

            about a week ago iwent to walmart, great, fantastic, place to shop. it has all of one needs and various discoveries.
            i went on the hunt to find a new keyboard and pie! i love pie. pie is so tasty. the pies at walmart are creamy, 
            light and fluffy with so much flavor and sweetness. unlike anything anyone will ever have. best party about
            it is that the pies are only 50 cents. perfect for the adverage broke man. theat movie norman... great movie. 
             chucky cheese smells really bad but has good wings but the tokens cost alot. cinnimon buns, one of the greatest pasties ever created. especially when its warm, and larde...pause
             but 7$ is alot but it was worth. fantastic...4... first 2 movies, great, but that 2014 moive.. absolutley dreadful. there are just some of those people out there with some great laughs.
            however you come across that those people with either annoying laughs or hidious laughs. people with dark humor. never understood why some people think death is funny. cream corn is disgusting.
